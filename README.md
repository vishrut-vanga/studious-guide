Financial Market Analysis and Predictive Signal Generation

Overview

This project explores financial market data through a data science lens, leveraging advanced statistical techniques and feature engineering to analyze trends and generate actionable trading signals. By focusing on technical indicators and rigorous data manipulation, this project highlights the power of data-driven decision-making in financial markets.

Key Objectives

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends in financial market data.
Engineer features using technical indicators such as RSI, Bollinger Bands, EMA, SMA, and ATR.
Visualize financial data and trading signals for interpretability and insights.
Backtest the effectiveness of the strategy using financial performance metrics.
Data Science Workflow

1. Data Acquisition and Preparation
Dataset: The dataset contains ~3,000 rows with the following columns:
Open, High, Low, Close prices
Volume (if applicable)
Preprocessing: Used NumPy and Pandas for:
Handling missing values
Normalizing price data for consistency
Calculating rolling statistics for indicators
2. Feature Engineering
Created multiple technical indicators to capture price movement patterns:

Relative Strength Index (RSI): Measures momentum by comparing the magnitude of recent gains to losses.
Bollinger Bands: Captures volatility by plotting bands above and below a moving average.
Exponential Moving Average (EMA): Tracks price trends while giving more weight to recent data.
Simple Moving Average (SMA): Smooths price data over a specific time period.
Average True Range (ATR): Quantifies market volatility.
3. Visualization
Data Visualization: Used Matplotlib and Plotly to:
Plot price trends over time
Overlay technical indicators and highlight buy/sell signals
Insights: Enhanced data storytelling by visualizing how technical indicators interact with price trends.
4. Backtesting and Evaluation
Metrics Used:
Sharpe Ratio: Assesses risk-adjusted returns.
Maximum Drawdown: Quantifies the largest peak-to-trough loss.
Total Return: Measures overall strategy performance.
Iterative Improvements: Incorporated feedback to refine feature selection and improve strategy results.
Results

Identified actionable trading signals based on the interaction of technical indicators.
Visualized clear buy/sell opportunities on time-series price graphs.
Evaluated strategy performance, providing insights into risk and return profiles.
Tools and Libraries

Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
Visualization: Matplotlib, Plotly
Performance Evaluation: Custom backtesting scripts
